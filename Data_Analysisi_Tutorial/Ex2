This example simulates the experiment of Rutherford and Geiger.

It is simulated as follows. Input quantities are the number N of decays
observed and the number nint of partial intervals ΔT of the total observation
time T . For simplicity the length of each partial interval is set equal to one. A total of
N random events are simulated by simply generating N random numbers uniformly
distributed between 0 and T . They are entered into a histogram with nint intervals.
The histogram is first displayed graphically and then analyzed numerically. For each
number k = 0,1, . . .,Nint the program determines how many intervals N(k) of the
histogram have k entries. The numbers N(k) themselves are presented in the form of
another histogram.
Show that for the process simulated in this example program one obtains in the
	limit N →∞
	N(k) = nintWN
	k (p = 1/nint) .
If N is increased step by step and at the same time λ = Np = N/nint is kept constant,
then for large N one has
WN
k (p = λ/N)→ λk
k! e−λ
and, in the limit N →∞,
N(k) = nint
λk
k! e−λ .
Check the above statements by running the program with suitable pairs of numbers,
e.g., (N,nint)=(4,2), (40,20), . . . , (2000,1000), by reading the numbers N(
